# Automated Venue Booking and Occupancy Monitoring System  

## Overview  
This software is designed to optimize venue management in academic institutions by automating booking processes and monitoring occupancy in real-time. By integrating **infrared sensor technology**, a robust **[Django backend](https://github.com/arion52/venue-management)**, and a **[Flutter mobile app](https://github.com/arion52/venue-management-flutter)**, the system provides a seamless and transparent user experience while enhancing operational efficiency.

## System Architecture  

1. **Infrared Sensors**  
   - Sensors installed at entry/exit points collect foot traffic data.  
   - Data is transmitted to the backend via Wi-Fi for processing.  

2. **Backend**  
   - Processes booking requests and synchronizes data between sensors and the mobile app.  
   - Ensures secure authentication and efficient API communication.  

3. **Mobile Application**  
   - Fetches real-time venue availability and booking information via APIs.  
   - Displays user-friendly interfaces for seamless interaction.
